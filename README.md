# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe is a popular paper-and-pencil game played by two players, often referred to as X and O. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with players taking turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty square. The objective of the game is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The game is typically played with one player using X's as their mark, and the other player using O's. The players take turns placing their marks on the grid until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, or until the grid is full and the game ends in a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is often used as a simple educational tool for teaching the concepts of strategy, critical thinking, and problem-solving to children. It is also a popular game for people of all ages to play as a casual pastime.
